# ObjectGame
This repository is a collection of games that uses object oriented programming. It is made only for the purpose of me, and is used to develop my skills further.

This repository uses the free open source pygame-library (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about).
The code in this rep is a result of the pygame-tutorials and is mainly for my own understanding and development.
